## How to Use

### Setup

1.  Get your **Telegram Bot Token** from @BotFather.
2.  Get your **Telegram Chat ID** send mass to @userinfobot.


## Convert to Executable (.exe)

You can convert the Python script into a standalone executable (`.exe`) file for easier distribution on Windows.

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    Open `cmd` or PowerShell and run:
    ```cmd
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2.  **Generate the Executable:**
    Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is saved, then run:
    ```cmd
    pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py
    ```
    * `--onefile`: Packages everything into a single `.exe` file.
    * `--noconsole`: Prevents a console window from opening when the `.exe` is run.

3.  **Find the Executable:**
    The generated `.exe` file (`main.exe` by default) will be located in the `dist` folder within your script's directory.

## Results
